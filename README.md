# UVic Formula Hybrid Website
Our new website (theme mostly)

## Scope
In order to keep our website system relatively simple and familiar for existing and new users, we're using the existing Wordpress setup and rebuilding a theme. For now, the theme is being developed locally on members' computers, and kept our [Formula Hybrid Github](https://github.com/UVicFH/) (ask Brendon for access), which can then be uploaded to our live version of the site manually.

## Dev
We're using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (a mac implementation of the LAMP stack) in order to create a local development environment to build our Wordpress theme.  
[Follow this link](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/developing-wordpress-locally-with-mamp/) for (albeit slightly out-dated) instructions on getting MAMP setup.
